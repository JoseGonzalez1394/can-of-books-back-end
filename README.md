# Project Name

**Author**: Jose Gonzalez Megan Seibert-Hughes
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Throughout this module, you’ll create a small app to track what books have impacted you, and what’s recommended to read next.

For today’s assignment, you will READ book data by connecting your front-end React app to a back-end Express server. Your Express server will connect to a Mongo database. You will need to make a “schema” in your back-end code to model how you want your data to look. You will then populate your database with “seed” data—some of your favorite books. When the front end makes a request to your server, your server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Your front end will display these results.

## Getting Started

## Architecture
Have one person on your team create a new repository from the front-end template repo called can-of-books-frontend.
Have another person on your team create a new repository from the back-end template repo called can-of-books-backend.
Add all partners as collaborators to both repos.
Have each member of the team clone the repos down to their local dev environment.
Use the Driver-Navigator collaboration strategy to perform all changes in the code, via pull requests from semantically-named branches. Switch off Driver often, so everyone on the team has a strong record of making contributions.
Review the .gitignore files to ensure they align with standard content for the repos, and add blank .env files, which must be in your .gitignore so as to not get pushed to GitHub.
Deploy BOTH the front-end and the back-end of your app to the cloud. It won't do much, but check for a proof-of-life indicator that the code is running. Your team will work with these same production deployments throughout the labs in this module.
Update the README.md file in each repo with documentation regarding your lab and its current state of development. Check the "Documentation" section in the lab for more details on how that should look AT MINIMUM.

## Credit and Collaborations
Megan Seibert-Hughes, TA's

Logistical
What hours will you be available to communicate?

Jose hawaii time (3 hours behind Seattle)
9am - 3am seattle time 

Megan Austin time (2 hours ahead Seattle)
9 am - 1am seattle time 

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Slack

How often will you take breaks?

every hour as needed, 10 minute breaks 

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

ask TA's fro help, slack instructor 

Cooperative
Make a list of each person’s strengths.

Megan- utilizing front end REACT, CSS, JSX

Jose- utilizing back end REACT, JSX

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

Megan- takes the front end REACT  

Jose- takes the back end REACT

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

Megan- back end JSX  

Jose- front end JSX

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

10 minute standup

pair programming to a T

switch between navigator and driver 

ask TA for help 

Conflict Resolution
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

it will not happen, pair programming is the core philosophy and practice 

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

open and clear communication
credit given when credit due to driver 

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

research, TA help, and Adam on speed dial, ask classmates for confirmation of task
